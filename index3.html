    <div class="main_block"> 
        <div>I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on new lines below me.</div>
        <div>We are separated by our margins. Because or margin collapsing, we are separated by the width or one or our margins, not both.  </div>
    </div>
    <div class="red">inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on the same line as one another, and adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the same line. Overflowing inline elements <span>wrap onto a new line if possible - like this one containing text</span>, or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do. </div>
    <div class="yellow">Now I'm absolutely positioned relative to the <body> element, not the <html> element!</div>
